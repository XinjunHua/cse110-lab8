# How are graceful degradation and service workers related? 
Graceful degradation and service workers are related in the context of providing a satisfying user experience even when certain features are not supported by a user's browser. Graceful degradation ensures that an application remains functional and accessible even if some features fail or are not supported. Service workers enhance this principle by allowing websites to work offline and manage network requests intelligently through caching.
